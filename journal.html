    <h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
    <p>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</p>
    <h2>August 20, 2012</h2>

    <ol>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
        through some interesting places on the way:
        <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
        <li>Magic City, ID</li>
        <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
        <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
        <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
        <li>Why, AZ</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
    <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <br>Passing cars,
        <br>When you can't see,
        <br>May get you,
        <br>A glimpse,
        <br>Of eternity.
    </blockquote>
    <p>I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>June 2, 2012</h2>

    <p>My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
        everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
        I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>cellphone</li>
        <li>iPod</li>
        <li>digital camera</li>
        <li>and a protein bar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q></p>
